1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
    given a database with the 100 most streamed songs from a user.


2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    - disregards the number of times a person listened to a particular song -> weighted average
    - disregards genre mixes
    - disregards other song attributes
    - disregards listening behaviour (e.g. listening to entire albums from one artist vs. only one song)
