Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Fewer simulations can omit teams all together. With 10 and 100 simulations, the general ordering seems ok. Nonetheless, the exact placement still varies/is incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The simulation seems to stabilize after 1000 or 10000 passes.
